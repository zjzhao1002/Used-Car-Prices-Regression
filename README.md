# Used-Car-Prices-Regression
The goal of this competition is to predict the price of used cars based on various attributes.
The [Regression of Used Car Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e9/) dataset from Kaggle has been used.
I use the **XGBoost** model to do the regression.
